# scala-learning

This project is consisted of my written experiments during I learn Scala, especially wage through *Programming Scala (Second Edition)*. Some code is directly derived from the book while the majority is not.

Generally this contains feature experiment, bytecode investigation sample and typical experiment application. More Scala-related experiments, see [Ray Eldath - whatever / scala](https://github.com/Ray-Eldath/whatever/tree/master/main/src/main/scala).
